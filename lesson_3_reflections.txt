When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If i want to share my files or so that i can access my files from other devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To have more control.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork   - copy of someones github repo, stored in git hub, and contributes to the orinal creator.
    Clone  - copy repo to your local working directory.
    Branch - when you want to implement some features, but also want to have original code, you create branch for that feature.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So you can work offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    By using phone, messengers or irl. In complex projects, when you need to keep track of all changes, its better to use github.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    To test some features and dont mess with original branch.
